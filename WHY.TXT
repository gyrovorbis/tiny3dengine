You wonder why the Tiny 3d Engine for VMU
took almost 3 years between completion and release?

You wonder why the subtitle is "War On Iraque Edition"?


The development of Tiny 3d Engine was stopped
about the time when the war on iraque began.
Although at that time I had nothing to do
with either people in america nor iraq,
the overall mood induced by Mr. Motherfuck himself
caused a dramatical impact in my life (that I won't explain in detail)
that holds on until today.
Well, I'm someone who does not forgive nor forget.
So this subtitle is just to remind that
this war did not only destroy lifes of
thousands from iraque and america,
but did also effect people who are not involved in any way.

Don't get me wrong about my huge dissappointment,
because this is only one of a million things in the world
that people can be dissappointed about.
